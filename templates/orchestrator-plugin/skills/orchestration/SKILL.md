# Orchestration Patterns

How to structure sisyphus sessions for common task types. This skill helps the orchestrator break work into tasks, choose agent types, sequence cycles, and handle failures.

## Core Principles

1. **plan.md is the orchestrator's memory.** plan.md and agent reports persist across cycles — they're all you have. Keep plan.md current and specific enough that a fresh orchestrator can pick up where you left off.

2. **Agents are disposable.** Each agent gets one focused instruction. If it fails or the scope changes, spawn a new one — don't try to redirect a running agent.

3. **Parallelize when independent.** If two tasks don't share files or depend on each other's output, spawn agents for both in the same cycle.

4. **Validate at boundaries.** After each logical phase completes, spawn a validation agent before moving on. Catching problems early prevents cascading rework.

5. **Reports are handoffs.** Agent reports should contain everything the next cycle's orchestrator needs — what was done, what was found, what's unresolved, where artifacts were saved.

## Agent Types Quick Reference

| Agent | Model | Use For |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `sisyphus:general` | sonnet | Ad-hoc tasks, summarization, simple questions |
| `sisyphus:debug` | opus | Bug diagnosis and root cause analysis |
| `sisyphus:spec-draft` | opus | Feature investigation and spec drafting |
| `sisyphus:plan` | opus | Implementation planning from spec |
| `sisyphus:review-plan` | opus | Validate plan covers spec completely |
| `sisyphus:test-spec` | opus | Define behavioral properties to verify |
| `sisyphus:implement` | sonnet | Execute plan phases, write code |
| `sisyphus:validate` | opus | Verify implementation matches plan |
| `sisyphus:review` | opus | Code review with parallel concern subagents |
| `sisyphus:tactician` | opus | Track plan progress, dispatch next task |
| `sisyphus:triage` | sonnet | Classify tickets by type/size |
