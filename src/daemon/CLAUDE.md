## Sessions Manifest (`sessions-manifest.ts`)

- Fires inside `dotsCallback` on every poll cycle — never called from request handlers. Best-effort; errors swallowed. Never rely on it having been called on any given mutation.
- Two types: `S` (phase from `getSisyphusPhases()`), `H` (non-`ssyph_` tmux sessions with `@sisyphus_cwd` set, phase always `null`). Home sessions queried by name not `$N` — `$` in numeric IDs shell-expands in `execSync`.
- `trackedCwds` is populated during S-entry enumeration but never consulted in the H loop — a non-`ssyph_` session whose `@sisyphus_cwd` matches a tracked project appears as both S and H. No deduplication.
- TSV `#ts:` header is Unix seconds; JSON `updatedAt` is milliseconds — inconsistent across formats. Consumer of JSON: `sisyphus tmux-sessions` (`src/cli/commands/tmux-sessions.ts`).

## State & Persistence

- All exported async functions in `state.ts` serialize through `withSessionLock(sessionId)` — a chained-promise per-session mutex. `createSession` and `createSnapshot` are synchronous and bypass the lock; a `createSnapshot` call can race with a concurrent `updateAgent` or `updateSession`.
- `getSession` silently normalizes missing fields on load (`activeMs → 0`, `agent.repo → '.'`, cycle `activeMs → 0`). Adding a new required field to `Agent`/`Session`/`OrchestratorCycle` types requires a normalization entry here, or reads of old state return `undefined`.
- `updateAgent`, `appendAgentReport`, and `updateReportSummary` reverse-find the **last** agent with the matching ID (`slice().reverse().find()`). A restarted agent appears twice in `session.agents` with the same ID; all mutations target the later (current) entry.
- `continueSession` side effects beyond status flip: clears `session.completedAt`/`completionReport`, clears the last cycle's `completedAt` (mode resolution then treats it as in-progress and skips it), and truncates `roadmap.md` to empty.
- `restoreSnapshot` always forces `status → 'paused'` and strips `tmuxSessionName`, `tmuxSessionId`, `tmuxWindowId` — caller must re-register tmux state before resuming. This is why `handleRollback` re-pauses and `sisyphus resume` must follow. Also restores `roadmap.md`, `strategy.md`, and `logs/` from snapshot (falls back to `logs.md` for pre-directory snapshots).
- `cloneSessionDir` copies `context/`, `prompts/`, `reports/`, `snapshots/` but creates a fresh empty `logs/`. Strategy file only copied when `strategy: true`. `replaceIdInDir` rewrites sourceId → cloneId in all non-binary files (null-byte heuristic on first 8 KB) across copied dirs. `context/CLAUDE.md` is overwritten with the seed content after copying — any agent-modified version from the source session is discarded.
- `createCloneState` normalizes any `running` agents from the source to `status: 'killed'` with `killedReason: 'inherited from source session'` — their tmux panes don't exist in the clone's context. Preserves `source.launchConfig` verbatim if present; `configModel`/`configOrchestratorPrompt` args are only used when source has no `launchConfig`. Sets `parentSessionId: sourceId`; resets `activeMs` to 0 but carries over all agents, cycles, and messages.
- `persistSessionRegistry()` only writes `cwd` — tmux/window metadata is in-memory only.
- Companion writes use own `loadCompanion()`/`saveCompanion()`, not `state.ts` — concurrent writes possible. Async commentary callbacks must reload fresh immediately before saving; never close over a captured companion reference across an `await`.
- `commentaryHistory` ring buffer (max 30): `recordCommentary()` maintains both `lastCommentary` and buffer simultaneously. `saveCompanion()` directly bypasses the buffer — `lastCommentary` and `commentaryHistory` diverge silently.
- Messages >200 chars are written to `messages/` and stored by reference; ≤200 chars are inlined in state JSON. Message IDs (`msg-001`, …) are sequential per session in-memory and reset on daemon restart.
- `companionCredited{Cycles,ActiveMs,Strength,Wisdom}` are written to session state on `handleComplete()` — `onSessionComplete()` reads these to skip already-credited work if the session is continued and completed again. Omitting the write causes double-counting.

## Respawn & Lifecycle

- `pendingRespawns` has no TTL — if `setImmediate` callback throws after `.add()` but before `.delete()`, session permanently blocked. Recovery: kill + restart.
- `onAllAgentsDone()` early-returns: (1) `orchestratorDone` not set → guard stays; (2) `status !== 'active'` outside `setImmediate` → clears `respawningSessions`, skips respawn → session stuck (recovery: kill + restart); inside `setImmediate`, `status === 'paused' && respawningSessions.has()` re-activates (pane monitor raced). Creates a cycle snapshot before spawning; `setImmediate` also recreates destroyed tmux windows, registering new IDs before spawning.
- `orchestratorDone` is checked both in-memory AND from `lastCycle.completedAt` in persisted state — handles daemon restart between yield and agents finishing.
- `respawningSessions` guard: set in `handleYield()` before killing the orchestrator pane, cleared in `onAllAgentsDone`'s `setImmediate` (or immediately if agents still running) — without it, pane monitor sees 0 panes and pauses mid-transition. If no windowId is resolvable after yield (neither `sessionWindowMap` nor `session.tmuxWindowId`), guard clears without spawning — session stays `active` but no orchestrator runs. Recovery: `sisyphus resume`.
- Always unregister panes from pane-registry and pane-monitor when killing/completing. `pane-exited` IPC notifications are silently dropped if the pane has no registry entry — orchestrator never learns the agent died.
- `handleSpawn()` called on a completed session reverts `status` to `'active'` — completion was not terminal. `companionCredited*` fields retain pre-completion values; `onSessionComplete()` skips re-crediting correctly when it completes again. Resolves windowId via `orchestrator.getWindowId(sessionId)` (in-memory only); fails post-restart. Contrast `handleRestartAgent()`, which falls back to `session.tmuxWindowId`.
- Orchestrator `pane-exited` without yield (crash) branches on agent state: (1) no agents → pause session; (2) agents running → clear `respawningSessions` guard and let them reach `onAllAgentsDone` naturally; (3) agents present but none running → trigger respawn immediately.
- `allAgentsDone()` counts ALL agents (including `sisyphus spawn` sub-agents) and returns false when `session.agents.length === 0` — an orchestrator with no spawns never triggers `onAllAgentsDone`. Last completing agent's pane is NOT killed in `handleAgentSubmit()` — deferred to `onAllAgentsDone()` so the tmux window survives for the new orchestrator pane.
- `resumeSession()` marks running agents as `lost` only if their pane is gone — live panes stay `running`. `restartAgent()` auto-transitions a zombie `running` agent to `lost` before restarting. `reconnectSession()` does NOT call `resetAgentCounterFromState()` — agent ID collision risk post-reconnect; `resume` and `clone` do call it.
- `reconnectSession()` vs `resumeSession()`: use `reconnect` when the tmux session still exists by name but its `$N` ID is stale (daemon restarted, tmux server survived) — it re-resolves the `$N` and re-registers without spawning an orchestrator. Use `resume` when the tmux session is gone entirely — it creates a fresh session and spawns a new orchestrator.
- `reopenWindow()` creates a fresh tmux session shell but does **not** spawn an orchestrator — used by TUI attach when the window is gone but the session isn't resumed. Call `resumeSession()` to spawn a new orchestrator.
- Orchestrator respawn failure inside `setImmediate` auto-pauses the session and fires a native notification — prevents it sitting in a half-active state. Recovery: fix the underlying issue, then `sisyphus resume`.

## Session ID Resolution (`server.ts`)

- `resolvePartialSessionId()` prefix-matches across: (1) in-memory `sessionTrackingMap`, (2) persisted registry, (3) on-disk scan of known cwds. Novel cwds are not discovered — `list --all` likewise only enumerates in-memory cwds. Sessions from projects not yet started require an explicit full ID or `cwd` hint.
- `resolvePartialSessionId()` hydrates `sessionTrackingMap` as a side-effect — sessions resolved from registry/disk get inserted with `messageCounter: 0`, restarting their `msg-NNN` sequence from `msg-001` even mid-daemon-lifetime.
- `resume`, `rollback`, `reconnect`, and `reopen-window` auto-register sessions from disk using the caller-provided `cwd` when the session ID isn't in memory — this is the post-restart recovery path. Other request types return `unknownSessionError`.
- `registerSessionCwd()` must be called before `registerSessionTmux()` — `registerSessionTmux` creates tracking with `cwd: ''` if absent; a subsequent `registerSessionCwd` call creates a fresh object, silently discarding any tmux metadata already set.
- `delete` physically removes the session directory from disk; `kill` only terminates processes and removes tracking.

## Agent Plugin System (`agent.ts`, `frontmatter.ts`, `plugins.ts`)

- `createAgentPlugin()` writes a per-agent plugin dir under `prompts/` at spawn time. Path is deterministic (`{agentId}-plugin`) so `restartAgent()` rebuilds it at the same location — but the dir is recreated from source each time. Any files agents wrote into the plugin dir at runtime are lost on restart.
- Same-named subdirectory adjacent to an agent's `.md` file: its `.md` files (excluding `CLAUDE.md`) become sub-agent definitions in the plugin. `$SISYPHUS_SESSION_DIR`/`$SISYPHUS_SESSION_ID` substituted at plugin-creation time, not at runtime.
- `permissionMode` frontmatter overrides `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; when set, uses `--permission-mode <value>` instead. Typed agent body is delivered via `--append-system-prompt` (or `--system-prompt` when `frontmatter.systemPrompt === 'replace'`).
- `restartAgent()` updates `spawnedAt` but preserves `originalSpawnedAt` (set only when absent); `restartCount` increments each call. Use `originalSpawnedAt ?? spawnedAt` for spawn-time filtering. Does NOT persist new `resumeArgs` — `agent.resumeArgs` in state permanently reflects the original spawn's flags.
- `detectProvider(model)` routes OpenAI model names to the `codex` CLI; `claudeSessionId` only injected for non-OpenAI agents — Codex spawns have no session continuity.
- Codex agents skip plugin/hooks entirely — no plugin dir, no Stop hook, no UserPromptSubmit. Prompt written to `{agentId}-codex-prompt.md`; model defaults to `codex-mini`. Codex agents can stop without submitting.
- `UserPromptSubmit` hook injected only for: `problem`, `plan`, `spec`, `review`, `review-plan`, `debug`, `operator`, `test-spec`, `explore`. Worker and unrecognized types get none. Interactive agents of recognized types still receive it — only Stop is skipped.
- Non-namespaced agent types resolve project → user-global → bundled only. Installed Claude Code plugins not searched. Use `namespace:name` for installed plugin agents (orchestrator sees bundled types only). `fallbackModel` frontmatter: if primary CLI absent from PATH, `agentConfig.frontmatter.model` is mutated in-place — agent state records the fallback; no separate log entry.
- `plugins` frontmatter field and `config.requiredPlugins` use `name@marketplace` format. `ensurePluginInstalled()` is **blocking at spawn time** (60s timeout); install failure logs a warning and agent spawns without the plugin. `parseAgentFrontmatter` is regex-based, not YAML — quoted strings, multi-line values, and nested structures are silently ignored; only `skills`/`plugins` support list syntax.
- Agent report `summary` in state is initially `content.slice(0, 200)`; asynchronously replaced by Haiku summarization. State read immediately after `handleAgentSubmit` may contain truncated text. `agent.repo` field: `'.'` means pane cwd = session cwd; any other value → `join(cwd, repo)`; used by `restartAgent()` to recreate the pane in the original directory.

## Session Naming (`session-manager.ts`)

- `fireHaikuNaming()` is fire-and-forget at session/clone start; skipped with explicit `--name`; null result keeps UUID silently; 5-attempt collision loop (`-1`–`-5`), abandoned if all taken. On success: renames the live tmux session, updates persisted state AND in-memory tracking, AND updates pane titles for ALL existing live panes via `updatePaneMeta` + `setPaneTitle`.

## History (`history.ts`)

- `emitHistoryEvent` is fire-and-forget (all exceptions swallowed) — appends JSONL to `~/.sisyphus/history/{sessionId}/events.jsonl`. History dir is global, not project-scoped.
- `pruneHistory()` keeps 200 sessions AND up to 90 days — entries beyond position 200 are only deleted if also older than 90 days (both conditions required).

## Status Dots (`status-dots.ts`)

- Orchestrator pane for phase detection is derived from `lastCycle.paneId` where `!lastCycle.completedAt` — read from persisted state, not in-memory maps. Phase detection survives daemon restarts.
- Claude hook state (idle/processing/stopped) is read from `/tmp/claude-tmux-state/{numericPaneId}`. `readClaudeState` strips the `%` prefix from tmux pane IDs before constructing the path.
- Completed sessions remain in dots for 5 minutes via TTL-based `completedSessions` map. Call `markSessionCompleted()` at completion or the dot disappears immediately.

## Pane Monitor (`pane-monitor.ts`)

- `hasRecentSessionActivity()` ignores `agent.status` — uses `spawnedAt`/`completedAt` timestamps within a 2-hour window instead. Prevents zombie sessions from inflating mood signals.
- State is re-read from disk after `handleAgentKilled()` before checking `allAgentsDone` — the kill mutates `session.agents` in persisted state, making the pre-kill in-memory reference stale.

## Tmux

- `ssyph_` prefix is load-bearing for pane-monitor detection. Session names containing tmux format characters (`#`, `{`, `}`) break status bar compositor silently — no escaping is applied.
- `TMUX_TIMEOUT_MS = 5_000` caps every tmux IPC call — a wedged tmux server (lock contention, blocked command queue) would otherwise block the daemon indefinitely (default `exec()` timeout is 30s).
- `sendKeys()` calls `getPaneState()` first (one tmux round-trip). Copy/clock mode → issues `send-keys -X cancel` before the real keys; skipping it silently routes the keys through the copy-mode key table instead of the shell.
- `sessionExistsById()` uses `has-session -t $N` (exact integer match, no prefix-match risk). `$N` IDs go stale after a tmux server restart — `isSessionAlive()` dispatches to `sessionExistsById` when a `$N` is available, otherwise falls back to `sessionNameTaken()`.
- `resolveSessionId()` uses `list-sessions` not `display-message -t <name>` — `display-message` requires an attached client and fails silently in daemon context.
- Pane border color is stored as per-pane `@pane_color` user variable; `pane-border-style` is window-level (last-write-wins). The window format string `#{@pane_color}` resolves the variable per-pane at render time, giving each pane its own border color without last-write clobbering.
- `configureSessionDefaults()` is called only inside `createSession()` — windows added to an existing tmux session after creation do not inherit `allow-rename off`, `automatic-rename off`, or layout rebalance hooks. Agents spawned in those windows can overwrite pane/window titles.

## Timing

- `flushAgentTimer(sessionId, agentId)` is read-only — returns full accumulated ms (not a delta). Pass into `updateAgent({activeMs})` to persist; it sets the **absolute** value. `flushTimers()` uses `incrementActiveTime` to persist session + all-agent + all-cycle deltas in a single lock acquisition (delta = in-memory − persisted). Both paths are safe to interleave because they serialize through `withSessionLock`.
- `handleRollback()` strict ordering: (1) flush timers, (2) capture `rollbackCount`, (3) `restoreSnapshot()` overwrites all state, (4) `deleteSnapshotsAfter(toCycle)` prunes future-cycle snapshots, (5) write `rollbackCount` back. Anything written before step 3 is lost. `deleteSnapshotsAfter` is permanent — rolling forward past the restore point requires re-running those cycles.
- `pollAllSessions` is sleep-aware: elapsed > 3× poll interval caps timer increment at `pollIntervalMs` — prevents hour-long inflation from a single wake event.

## Session Housekeeping

- `pruneOldSessions()` runs on every `startSession` / `cloneSession`: keeps the 10 most-recent completed sessions **plus** any completed within the last 7 days. Active/paused sessions never pruned.
- `switchToHomeSession()` is called before `tmux.killSession()` in both `handleComplete()` and `handleKill()` — reversing this order detaches clients before they can switch.
- `cloneSession()` can only clone non-completed sessions; seeds clone's agent counter from source state via `resetAgentCounterFromState()`. Always forces `'strategy'` mode on the clone's first cycle.

## Companion

- `lastLateNightCommentary` resets on daemon restart (memory-only 30-min cooldown) — first post-2am poll after restart fires unconditionally.
- Call `recomputeDots()` after any handler that changes session phase — omitting leaves dashboard stale until next poll.
- `onSessionComplete()` return value (new achievement IDs) must be inspected — achievement commentary only fires if the array is non-empty.
- `captureObservationContext` must be called before `onSessionComplete` to snapshot pre-mutation companion state. `runPostSessionObservations` fires after `saveCompanion()` as fire-and-forget; errors are logged but otherwise silent. The memory context passed to `fireCompletionCommentary` reflects the pre-session repo state — observations from this session are not yet persisted.
- `companion.sessionsCompleted` increments unconditionally in `onSessionComplete` — NOT delta-safe. A continue→re-complete inflates the count, unlike `strength`/`wisdom`/`endurance`/`patience` which use `companionCredited*` deltas.
- `shouldGenerateCommentary` probabilistically suppresses: `agent-crash` fires 30%, `idle-wake` 50%. All other event types (`session-start`, `session-complete`, `level-up`, `achievement`, `late-night`, `cycle-boundary`) always generate.

## Orchestrator Prompt Assembly (`orchestrator.ts`)

- Mode resolution: `forceMode` → last *completed* cycle's `mode` → `'strategy'`. The `.reverse().find(c => c.completedAt)` scan skips any in-progress cycle, so an orchestrator that crashed mid-cycle doesn't influence mode.
- `.sisyphus/orchestrator.md` (project override) replaces the entire system prompt — `orchestrator-base.md` and mode body are not appended. `{{AGENT_TYPES}}`, `{{ORCHESTRATOR_MODES}}`, and `$SISYPHUS_*` substitutions still apply if placeholders exist.
- Only `bundled` (`sisyphus:*`) agent types are injected into the orchestrator system prompt — project/user/plugin-discovered types are deliberately hidden.
- Context section switches on cycle number: cycle 1 inlines `session.context` text; cycles 2+ reference the `context/` directory by `@path`. Files written there by agents during cycle 1 only become visible to the orchestrator at cycle 2.
- `drainMessages` is called inside `spawnOrchestrator` before the tmux pane is created — messages are consumed even if pane spawn subsequently fails. No retry path.
- Goal source: `goal.md` file → `session.task`. `updateTask()` is the safe path — updates both within the session lock. Direct `updateSession({task})` skips `goal.md`; orchestrator still reads the old goal on the next cycle.
- `handleOrchestratorComplete` does not kill the orchestrator pane — only `handleOrchestratorYield` does. The complete path assumes the pane already exited before the IPC hook fires.
- `resolveOrchestratorPane`: in-memory `sessionOrchestratorPane` → `lastCycle.paneId` from persisted state; `sessionWindowMap` (window ID) has no persisted fallback — layout adjustment in `handleYield` is silently skipped post-restart. `cleanupSessionMaps` must be called on every kill/complete — omitting leaks entries in `sessionWindowMap`, `sessionOrchestratorPane`, and the pane registry.
