## Goal

Audit the sisyphus metrics/analytics system for architectural issues and coverage gaps, then implement improvements. "Done" means: (1) a clear architectural critique with identified issues, (2) a coverage gap analysis documenting what we should track but don't, and (3) implemented fixes — cleaner architecture, new tracking for missing metrics, and improved history/stats CLI output. All data remains local-only. Scope includes history.ts, history-types.ts, state.ts, session-manager.ts, pane-monitor.ts, companion.ts, agent.ts, and the history CLI command. Out of scope: external telemetry, TUI rendering, companion mood/achievement logic (unless it's buggy).

## Continuation Instructions

Plan agent (agent-003) should have produced context/plan-implementation.md. Review the plan for completeness against the approved scope in strategy.md. Check file conflict analysis, dependency ordering, and task granularity. If the plan is solid, transition to implementation mode. If gaps exist, spawn a fix agent or revise and re-plan.
